*Developed in 2019 with close input from EMBL senior scientists*

EMBL needs a strong, overarching brand: EMBL first. If necessary, sub entities such as sites or projects should be expressed after the parent brand  .

1. Make the design sustainable
2. Show our work
 3. Keep it simple 
4. We are one institute 
5. Physical, digital, and environmental are in sync
6. Make our work visible 
7. White space is important


1. Make it sustainable

We will create a long-term, sustainable system. Designed for efficiency, re-use, and scale.

Sustainable systems are diverse and productive indefinitely. Being holistically focussed on how EMBL interacts with its audiences internal and external, means we create meaningful, sustainable experiences over the longer term.

2. Show our work

We will prioritise demonstration over discussion. Through prototyping we will show how these principles and values apply to the work.

We will embrace modern design practices by starting small and iterating quickly. We will avoid big reveals and develop a process of publishing early and often. This requires a change of mindset of the team: to be comfortable with ‘not done yet’; to be satisfied to prioritise function over form; to get the things we make in the hands of our audience so we can understand their needs more quickly.

3. Keep it simple

We will do the difficult work to keep the things we make simple, approachable, and put the user’s needs first.

EMBL is complex. As are the audiences, services, applications, and communications material that operate within the brand. We will do the hard work to uncover and expose the simplicity of the core.

4. We are all one institute

We will cultivate cross-pollination of services, products, ideas, and collaboration.
We will proactively seek out opportunities to collaborate on the design of services across all channels throughout EMBL and invite feedback and new perspectives. We will share and discuss our methods.

5. Physical, digital, and environmental are in sync

We will ensure a holistic approach for one system for all printed, digital and environmental touch-points.
Design systems across media evolve at different rates. We will ensure systems across all channels are relevant to the media, but also share nomenclature, design patterns, and are built from the same principles. We will think and act as a cross-disciplinary design team.

6. Make our work visible

We will make the design language accessible where people are already working.
Forging a new path is hard. And sometimes a waste of energy. By understanding how the brand is expressed currently, we develop new ways to provide the ingredients of the brand to the people already doing the work, in the place they are doing it. We will invent new ways with which to distribute the brand across a constantly moving, evolving system. We shouldn’t press pause.

7. White space is important

All our designs will incorporate a degree of white space to increase legibility and to allow the designs to breathe.
