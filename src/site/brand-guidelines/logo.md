The EMBL logo is protected under the Paris Convention, which protects names and logos of intergovernmental organisations. You may not use or reproduce the logo without EMBL’s explicit consent.

*Elements of the logo*
The EMBL logo is made up of two elements:
- Word mark (“EMBL”)
- Image mark (a hexagon made up of dots (5 per side) balanced on one of its points)

The word and image marks together make up the EMBL logo. The image mark may be used by itself in certain circumstances. The word mark must not be used by itself.

## EMBL logo variations
There are three variations of the EMBL logo and the EMBL image mark:

- Colour
- Black
- White

### EMBL logo: colour version
The colour version of the logo and image mark should be used where possible. It may only be used on a plain white background.

### EMBL logo: black version
The black version of the EMBL logo is intended for use against light backgrounds, and may be used over images or textures, providing that there is sufficient contrast so that it can be easily seen and identified. It may also be used on surfaces that are not opaque, such as glass.

###  EMBL logo: white version
The white version of the EMBL logo is intended for use against dark backgrounds, and may be used over images or textures, providing that there is sufficient contrast so that it can be easily seen and identified. It may also be used on surfaces that are not opaque, such as glass.

### EMBL logo: colour version with white letters
The colour version of the logo and image mark should be only used for co-branding when other logos are coloured as well. This logo version may only be used on black background. It may only be used on a plain white background.

## EMBL logo positioning
Where the product is an EMBL product, the EMBL logo should be aligned to the top and right of the product, where possible.

*EMBL logo positioning on digital products*
On digital products where the logo is a navigational element, it should be aligned at the top and left of the interface. On digital products where the EMBL logo is a link it should always link to http://www.embl.org

## EMBL logo spacing
The EMBL logo should have free space around it so that it does not touch adjacent elements or the side of the medium. This space should be at least equivalent to the height of the letter ‘E’ in the word mark.

## EMBL logo sizing

The EMBL logo should appear large enough so that: the letters in the word mark remain readable; and the dots that make up the image mark remain discernable.

The minimum width and height of the image mark are: 30px or 4mm.
