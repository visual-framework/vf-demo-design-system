## Making websites

General guidance, tips and screenshots.

## 1. This design system

[Some text about your design system].

This design system uses the [Visual Framework](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-welcome/) (VF), designed with the needs of life science websites and services. It goes beyond guidance for tables, graphs, data-heavy typography and focuses on sane defaults. It implements CSS in a way that does not interfere with existing components. The VF 2.0 enables consistency and portability, it is extensible, modular and overridable; here to help and not get in the way.

### 2. Boilerplates

[Boilerplate templates to come]

### 3. Patterns and components

Once you've started with a template above follow guidance and copy-paste examples from the Component library.
